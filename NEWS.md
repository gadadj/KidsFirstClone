As part of this release, we have forked the Overture projects to the Fids First team: Ego, Persona, Rollcall and Riff.
We also improved significantly the documentation for the deployment of all services. We standardized the deployment
process for Riff. We also did the investigation and implementation of the backend for login in with ORCID with Ego.
